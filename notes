Temporal scheme test
======================

Various temporal schemes are examined on a 1-D structured mesh, where a
passive scalar (T) is convected along the Cartesian x-axis using a
uniform flow velocity of (1, 0, 0).  Executing:
./Allrun (choose appropriate OpenFOAM version)

will update the system/fvSchemes file to use each scheme listed in the file
system/schemesToTest and perform the test using the scalarTransportFoam solver.

A test file for each run is generated that can be used to compare the predicted
scalar profile against the exact solution.
